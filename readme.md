Dymenstion TypeScript SDK

The Dymenstion TypeScript SDK is a hobbyist-friendly toolkit designed for enthusiasts interested in building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Dymenstion blockchain. Taking inspiration from the Injective TypeScript SDK, it provides an accessible set of tools for hobbyist developers to explore blockchain development.

Contributions and Bug Fixes:

This SDK is a work in progress, and as such, there may be bugs or areas for improvement. Hobbyists are encouraged to contribute to the project by identifying bugs, suggesting enhancements, or submitting fixes. Together, we can improve the SDK and create a more robust and enjoyable development experience for all hobbyists.

Getting Started:

Begin your hobby project by installing the SDK via npm:

`npm install @mrtruongleo/dym-ts-sdk`

Explore the SDKâ€™s modules and start experimenting with blockchain features in your projects.
